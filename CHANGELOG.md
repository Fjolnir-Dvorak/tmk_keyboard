# CHANGELOG #

## 1.0.3 ##

- cherry-picked gcc-avr 7 fix
  (https://github.com/cub-uanic/tmk_keyboard/issues/42)

I promise I’ll merge upstream changes. Some time. I tried now, but there’s too 
many things that break. I can’t invest the time now while the current version 
still works, so … I’ll probably do it eventually.

## 1.0.2 ##

- merged upstream changes from cub_uanic’s fork
- fixed #3: KVM macro not working

## 1.0.1 ##

- merged minor upstream changes
- updated README: now with image!

## 1.0.0 ##

- initial release
